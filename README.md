# 🎮 Day 8 – Voice Game Master (D&D-Style Adventure)  
**Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge**

For Day 8, I stepped into the world of interactive storytelling and turned my voice agent into a **D&D-style Game Master** — fully voice-driven, immersive, and dynamic.

### 🧙‍♂️ What I Built
I created a **voice-only Game Master** that:
- Runs a cohesive story inside a single fantasy universe  
- Maintains continuity using just the conversation history  
- Speaks in a clear GM persona and ends every turn with: *“What do you do?”*  
- Guides the player through scenes, decisions, and a short adventure arc  
- Shows both GM text output + player speech transcription in the UI  

This was all powered using **Murf Falcon**, the fastest TTS API out there — making real-time narration feel super smooth.

### 🛠️ Extras I Explored
I pushed beyond the basics and experimented with:
- A structured **JSON world state**  
- Player stats + inventory tracking  
- Light RPG mechanics using simple checks  

Still a work-in-progress, but the engine is already feeling surprisingly alive 👀

### 🎥 Demo
I’ve uploaded a short gameplay video showing the voice-driven adventure in action.  
(Will upload frontend + backend code soon!)

Super excited to keep leveling this up over the final stretch of the challenge.
